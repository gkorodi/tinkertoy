# tinkertoy

This is just a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) based mini application.

# The Application

The application is a single python script, running a FastAPI server. Check the Swagger documentation of the application once it is deployed. There is no UI, except what is generated by the FastAPI Swagger component by default. [Tinkertoy Swagger Localhost](http://localhost:8000/docs)

The minimum dependencies for the application is a single library called FastAPI. In addition, the `unicorn` library is included, to be able to run the app locally, with more bells and whistles for webtraffic. See this [good explanation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/how-wsgi-vs-asgi-is-like-baking-a-cake) why.

Basic foreground run of the application is with:

```sh
fastapi dev fastapi/app.py

```

## Testing

If `pytest` is installed, just run `pytest` from the root/app directory, and see what happens.
