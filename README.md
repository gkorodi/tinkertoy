# tinkertoy

This is just a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) based mini application.

## Testing

If `pytest` is installed, just run `pytest` from the root/app directory, and see what happens.

# The Application

The application is a single python script, running a FastAPI server. Check the Swagger documentation of the application once it is deployed. There is no UI, except what is generated by the FastAPI Swagger component by default.

The minimum dependencies for the application is a single library called FastAPI. In addition, the `unicorn` library is included, to be able to run the app locally, with more bells and whistles for webtraffic. See this [good explanation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/how-wsgi-vs-asgi-is-like-baking-a-cake) why.

# Deploy to Azure App Service - Sample Application

To deploy our toy API with Azure Quickstart see [Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python). For instructions on how to create the Azure resources and deploy the application to Azure, refer to the article.

Sample applications are available for the other frameworks here:

* Django [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-django-webapp-quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-django-webapp-quickstart)
* FastAPI [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-fastapi-webapp-quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-fastapi-webapp-quickstart)

If you need an Azure account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Commands to script with for Azure deployment

Of course, installing the `az` command on your particular system is a prerequisite. Also, logging in with `az login` and having an actual account with enough privileges to deploy the webapp is also required. _Note: More on Azure infrastructure setup, later._

### Deploy

```sh

APP_SERVICE_NAME="tinkertoy"
az webapp up --runtime PYTHON:3.12 --sku B1 --logs --name $APP_SERVICE_NAME`

```

The `--runtime` parameter specifies what version of Python your app is running. To list all available runtimes, 
use the command `az webapp list-runtimes --os linux --output table`.

The `--sku` parameter defines the size (CPU, memory) **and cost** of the app service plan.  This example uses the **B1 (Basic)** service plan, which will incur a small cost in your Azure subscription. Don't forget to shut down the app if not used! See instructions below.

For a full list of App Service plans, view the App Service pricing page.

The `--logs` flag configures default logging required to enable viewing the log stream immediately after launching the webapp.

You can optionally specify a name with the argument `--name <app-name>`. If you don't provide one, then a name will be automatically generated.

You can optionally include the argument `--location <location-name>` where `<location_name>` is an available *Azure region*. You can retrieve a list of allowable regions for your Azure account by running the [az account list-locations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/appservice#az-appservice-list-locations) command.

### Configure logging

`az webapp log config --web-server-logging filesystem --name $APP_SERVICE_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

### Tail the log for a running application

`az webapp log tail --name $APP_SERVICE_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`


### Delete an Azure Resource Group

`az group delete --name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME # --no-wait`
